    "sad": [
      "Sadness is characterized by low energy, reduced motivation, and decreased levels of serotonin and dopamine. The right nutrients can help support your emotional well-being.",
      "When feeling sad, your body benefits from nutrients that provide 'emotional stimulation' and biochemical support for neurotransmitter production.",
      "Sadness can affect your brain chemistry. Certain nutrients can help restore balance to mood-regulating neurotransmitters like serotonin."
    ],
    "happy": [
      "Happiness represents a state of biochemical harmony. The right nutrients can help maintain this positive emotional state.",
      "When you're feeling happy, your body can benefit from nutrients that sustain this positive biochemical balance.",
      "A happy mood is supported by nutrients that reinforce serotonin production and stabilize emotional regulation pathways."
    ],
    "fear": [
      "Fear activates defensive neural mechanisms and triggers oxidative stress. Certain nutrients can help calm and restore balance.",
      "When experiencing fear, your body needs nutrients that can reduce anxiety through GABA enhancement and stress hormone regulation.",
      "Fear states involve heightened neurological excitability and physiological stress responses that can be modulated with specific nutrients."
    ],
    "neutral": [
      "A neutral emotional state needs maintenance of positive baseline emotions to prevent negative fluctuations.",
      "While emotionally stable, your neutral state benefits from nutrients that provide steady energy and support neurotransmitter synthesis.",
      "The neutral state requires a balance of nutrients that foster calm alertness and cognitive clarity."
    ],
    "surprise": [
      "Surprise lies between fear and joy, temporarily throwing the brain out of balance as it adapts to new information.",
      "The surprised state requires a balance between stabilization and light modulation of brain chemistry.",
      "Surprise increases adrenaline slightly and changes heart rate, requiring nutrients that support both alertness and emotional regulation."
    ],
    "disgust": [
      "Disgust is a self-protective mechanism that can affect the gut-brain connection and requires both calming and gentle reactivation.",
      "When feeling disgust, your body benefits from nutrients that restore gut comfort and support the gut-brain axis.",
      "Disgust responses can be eased with nutrients that reduce visceral tension and support mucosal health."
    ],
    "angry": [
      "Anger triggers the sympathetic nervous system, increasing cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressureâ€”harmful if prolonged.",
      "When angry, your body needs nutrients that can calm the nervous system and reduce the physiological impact of stress hormones.",
      "Anger creates a physiological stress response that certain nutrients can help regulate, supporting emotional de-escalation."
